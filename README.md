# Spectral Clustering for Outlier Detection

## Project Overview

- **Spectral Clustering Approach**: Implemented a spectral clustering-based method to detect outliers from scratch, focusing on identifying malicious dealers within datasets.
- **Laplacian Matrix and Eigenvectors**: Utilized the Laplacian matrix and eigenvector extraction to uncover intrinsic patterns and structures in the data, crucial for effective clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering and Outlier Analysis**: Employed k-means clustering along with centroid-based outlier analysis, enabling the precise identification of anomalous data points.
